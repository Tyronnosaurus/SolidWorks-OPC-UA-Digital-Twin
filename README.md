# SolidWorks-OPC-UA-Digital-Twin
This project is still in development and nothing useful has been implemented yet.

A sidepanel AddIn for Solidworks. The user can connect Solidworks' dimensions to OPC-UA variables from a simulated industrial controller. This allows for visualizing 3D movement before building hardware.

Check repository at github.com/angelsix/solidworks-api for tutorials on how the Solidworks API is being used here.
